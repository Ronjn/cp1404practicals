Q: regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

A: I think I got a lot better at estimating as I went, but I still seemed to always underestimate how long it would take.

Q: regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

A: I think the reviews were good, even though just done by other students it was helpful to receive feedback from another perspective, even just doing the reviews was helpful to see how others had solved a problem that you maybe had trouble with.

Q: regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

A: I cant remember if it was prac 7 I think where the prac task was literally bigger than our first assignment, yeah I would probably change that and I think prac 9 could use some work when it comes to instruction and explaining things as I think a lot of us students struggled there because it was confusing.
